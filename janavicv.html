				Hi. I am Janavi Anand. This is my new try on presenting my resume as a web page. I got placed in Cognizant technology solutions when I was in my second year in college and joined the same as programer trainee on 28th december 2009. Due to my pregnancy and health issues I was advised by my doctor to discontinue my career. In 2011, did certification course on CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate). 
				Then joined Masters in 2012 and completed the same in 2014 with gold medal. I came to USA with my husband on H4 visa and was waiting for EAD to start my career. Meanwhile, got my hands on HTML, CSS, java and java script and also helped my friends to research on new technologies and on publishing papers on international journal.
